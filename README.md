Desktop panel indicator for YandexDisk CLI client for Linux (GTK+)

##### NOTE: 

If You are looking for YandexDisk indicator for KDE or other non-GTK based DE take a look on [yd-go](https://github.com/slytomcat/yd-go). _yd-go_ is a little simpler indicator written in golang. It uses D-BUS to communicate with the desktop notification plugin, that's why yd-go is fully independent off Desktop Environment.

### IMPORTANT:

Indicator responsible only for showing the synchronisation status in the desctop panel. All the synchronisation operations are perfomed by [yandex-disk utility from Yandex](https://yandex.ru/support/disk-desktop-linux/index.html).

### INSTALLATION:

See installation instruction in [Wiki](https://github.com/slytomcat/yandex-disk-indicator/wiki)

### INTERFACE LANGUAGES

English, Russian, Greek, Bulgarian, Belorussian.

- `yandex-disk-indicator` is copied to `/usr/bin/yandex-disk-indicator` and marked as executable (chmod a+x ...)
- `fm-actions/` and `icons/` folders, `ya-setup` and `*.py` files are located in `/usr/share/yd-tools` folder
- `*.desktop` files were placed in `/usr/share/applications` folder
- compiled language files (`translations/*.mo`) are located in the system depended folders (i.e. `usr/share/locale/{LANG}/LC_MESSAGES/` in Linux)
- `ya-setup` utility translations files (`translations/ya-setup*.lang`) are located in `/usr/share/yd-tools/translation` folder
NOTE: All action above can be done via running of `build/install.sh` script
- indicator settings are stored in `~/.config/yd-tools/yandex-disk-indicator.conf` (file is automatically created on the first start).
